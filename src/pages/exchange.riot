  <p>Trading directly on the exchange offers additional opportunities to achieve rewarding growth potential, typically between 20-40% per month.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> After 17 days this trading experiment has concluded with mixed results.</p>

  <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Attractive yields of around 1% per day should mean around 30% per month. In reality, it appeared to be less than that. This could be due to a combination of a realatively small trading amount of around $500 and the commission fees. I would deem this an attractive opportunity if trading with a larger amount of, say, $10,000.</p>
