Mystery Company 1 is a crypto trading platform and Mystery Company 2 is a cloud mining company. Both offer good returns and I\'m performing a trial investment in both and will report my findings once I have sufficient data.</p><p>Mystery Company 1 is a crypto trading exchange that offers enticing returns around 1-200% per month based on your risk appetite. They offer currencies to be bought and sold on the exchange, options, ETFs, and dual currency trades.</p><p>Mystery Company 2 mines Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Vault (BTCV) and has various plans which earn a monthly commission based on the hash rate of transactions performed for the currency of your choice. Returns are estimated around 20% per month but may vary based on the demand of the chosen currency.</p><hr/><h2>Update</h2><h3>Crypto Exchange</h3><p>Trading directly on the exchange offers additional opportunities to achieve rewarding growth potential, typically between 20-40% per month.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After 17 days this trading experiment has concluded with mixed results.</p><p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Attractive yields of around 1% per day should mean around 30% per month. In reality, it appeared to be less than that. This could be due to a combination of a realatively small trading amount of around $500 and the commission fees. I would deem this an attractive opportunity if trading with a larger amount of, say, $10,000.</p><p>Here are the trading results for posterity:</p><div id="exchange-results"></div>',[])},name:"currently-reviewing"}}.call(this,n(152))}}]);
