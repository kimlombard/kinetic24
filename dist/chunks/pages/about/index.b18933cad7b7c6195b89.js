No, I'm not a professional investor, fund manager or banker. Quite the opposite, really. I work really hard and expect the same kind of performance from my investments.</p><p>This is the no-frills version of what I believe to be the easiest way to grow your investment in a manner that produces real returns, in a transparent manner, with no fees, and no fuss. I believe that good things don't need a song and dance.</p><p>There are many things I like about MTI that tick all the right boxes, but here are a few that really catch my attention. There are no fees whatsoever. No membership fees. No deductions of any kind. You can deposit and withdraw at no cost and have access to your funds within 24-48 hours, depending on the time of day you issue your instruction. They have a great backend that displays all daily trades, your earnings, statement history, and so much more. Their official means of communication is via Telegram as well as plenty of videos via their YouTube channel.</p><p>The goal of the company is to grow your Bitcoin investment. Investments are in BTC, are always held in BTC, and are never converted to another currency (fiat or otherwise). They use AI with a third-party trading company to trade on either/or or both the crpto and forex markets. Daily trades consistently end in a profit with attractive margins.</p><p>While investing in a fund may be attractive, minimum deposit requirements are usually fairly steep, have lock-in restrictions, and offer returns in the region of around 10-25% annually. This company is not like that. They offer good returns and give you the freedom to access your funds on demand. So you can choose to invest during favorable periods and to withdraw as you see fit.</p><p>Importantly, the minimum deposit of 100 USD is affardable to most. All investors earn the same commission, which is 40% of daily profits. There is an optional referral program which you can use to create your team, and there are various bonuses attached to that.</p><p>The company that I actively invest in is Mirror Trading International (MTI) and have been investing with them since February 2020. I encourage you to take a more detailed look to see what all the fuss is about over on the next page.</p>",[])},name:"about"}}}]);
